To get git to track a file, you write:

git add foo.sh

Now it's "tracked."

If you do git status you can check the difference. When you're ready to put it in the repo, you can save the current version:

git commit

or 

git commit foo.sh -m "New foo does this thing."

NOT

"Committed."

git commit -am "asdlfkj;we"

This commits all the files.

Then when you push, it goes to the repo. 

Everyday, just:

pull  --- commit --- push
      ^(Maybe add, for new stuff).

If you try to push without pulling, git will complain on you.

If you edited the same line, you'll have a merge conflict. It'll be sad.
